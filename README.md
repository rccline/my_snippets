## My Snippets Repository  

This repository is a copy of my RStudio snippets.  Snippets are retained in User directories.  For example, I run RStudio as User Robert and as User Administrator.  

Therefore, my snippet files are located in the following two directories:   

* "C:\\Users\\Robert\\AppData\\Roaming\\RStudio\\snippets\\"  

* "C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\RStudio\\snippets\\"
